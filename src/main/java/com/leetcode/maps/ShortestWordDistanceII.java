/**
 * Level: Medium
 * Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii/ (premium)
 * Problem Description:
 * This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and
 * your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?
 * <p>
 * Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words
 * word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * Given word1 = "coding”, word2 = "practice”, return 3.
 * Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
 * <p>
 * Note: You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, for a simpler variant, see {@link com.leetcode.arrays.ShortestWordDistance}.
