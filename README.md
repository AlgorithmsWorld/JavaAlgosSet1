# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

The repo consists of solutions to numerous problems using different data structures and algorithms, all coded in Java. It also contains solutions to HackerRank problems which I have solved so far and also questions from Cracking the Coding Interview Book _(6th Edition)_.

You can also refer to my [Java Notes](http://java.ramswaroop.me) for a quick refresh on the Java concepts.
